00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:31,198
Ooh. Ooh-la-la.

2
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:33,101
Illumination!

3
00:00:33,136 --> 00:00:36,302
<i>And now for a bedtime story.</i>

4
00:00:37,877 --> 00:00:39,437
♪ ♪

5
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:43,012
<i>Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful pond.</i>

6
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,619
<i>It was paradise.</i>

7
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:48,985
<i>Everyone was happy there.</i>

8
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,219
<i>Well, not everyone.</i>

9
00:00:52,254 --> 00:00:54,089
<i>For two ducklings were suffering</i>

10
00:00:54,124 --> 00:00:56,553
<i>from a strange condition.</i>

11
00:00:56,588 --> 00:00:58,632
<i>They were bored.</i>

12
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:02,867
<i>And they were eager to
discover what lay beyond</i>

13
00:01:02,902 --> 00:01:04,869
<i>their cozy little pond.</i>

14
00:01:04,904 --> 00:01:06,464
Come on. Let's have a look.

15
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,939
But Daddy says it's dangerous
to leave the pond.

16
00:01:08,974 --> 00:01:10,710
We're brave and strong.

17
00:01:10,745 --> 00:01:12,239
We ain't scared of nothing.

18
00:01:12,274 --> 00:01:15,209
<i>So they decided to go for it,</i>

19
00:01:15,244 --> 00:01:17,915
<i>straight into the arms of...</i>

20
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,115
<i>predators!</i>

21
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,728
<i>They were surrounded, trapped.</i>

22
00:01:28,763 --> 00:01:30,356
<i>But the ducklings
were not afraid.</i>

23
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:34,459
<i>The tiny heroes attacked
the predator, and...</i>

24
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,164
they died.

25
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,902
The end.

26
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:41,708
Uh, that's all? They're dead?

27
00:01:41,743 --> 00:01:43,534
Oh, yeah. No survivors.

28
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:44,744
But how?

29
00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:46,141
Oh, you want details? Okay.

30
00:01:46,176 --> 00:01:47,780
So, first,
the heron cut them in half...

31
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:49,045
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

32
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,047
Wait a second here.

33
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:53,610
Your father got
the story wrong... again.

34
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:55,084
What really happened was:

35
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,053
<i>The heron saw
that they were lost,</i>

36
00:01:57,088 --> 00:01:58,857
<i>so she offered to help them.</i>

37
00:01:58,892 --> 00:02:00,584
<i>Pam, it's a heron.</i>

38
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:03,895
<i>A psycho killer
designed to eat ducklings.</i>

39
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,358
<i>All right, fine.</i>

40
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:07,294
<i>The heron was about to eat them.</i>

41
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:11,133
<i>But their parents arrived
just in time and saved them.</i>

42
00:02:11,168 --> 00:02:13,135
<i>Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.</i>

43
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,501
<i>Their parents arrived,
but it was too late.</i>

44
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:17,975
Oh, Dax, don't worry.

45
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,208
It's going to be okay.

46
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:21,605
Really, Dad?

47
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,112
Yeah, sure.

48
00:02:23,147 --> 00:02:25,444
Squished ducks, they can
achieve great things, too.

49
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,951
As long as they stay in the pond

50
00:02:26,986 --> 00:02:28,722
far from the dangers
of the world,

51
00:02:28,757 --> 00:02:31,087
such as herons
and bears and wolves

52
00:02:31,122 --> 00:02:33,320
and storms and cyclones

53
00:02:33,355 --> 00:02:36,389
and tornadoes and crocodiles
and poisonous mushrooms...

54
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:38,963
Okay. I really need
to get to bed now.

55
00:02:38,998 --> 00:02:40,734
...and saber-toothed tigers...

56
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:42,230
What happened to
the other duckling?

57
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:44,496
- Was she squished, too?
- Oh, no, no, no.

58
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:45,871
Don't worry, Gwen.

59
00:02:45,906 --> 00:02:47,466
The ducklings were both safe.

60
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,270
They just went on their way
right back to the pond.

61
00:02:49,305 --> 00:02:51,371
But another predator
came in and...

62
00:02:51,406 --> 00:02:53,813
And wished them good day.

63
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:55,672
The end.

64
00:02:55,707 --> 00:02:57,311
That's it.

65
00:02:59,216 --> 00:03:00,644
Okay.

66
00:03:01,955 --> 00:03:03,218
Good night, Mom.

67
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:05,418
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.

68
00:03:07,092 --> 00:03:08,652
What?

69
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:12,194
Every time you tell a story,
Gwen wets her twig bed.

70
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,833
Does she? That's great.

71
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:16,066
See? That means
she's learning, Pam.

72
00:03:16,101 --> 00:03:17,463
Oh, learning what?

73
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:19,498
That she should never
leave the pond?

74
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,071
Exactly.

75
00:03:21,106 --> 00:03:23,007
Trust me, I'm teaching her
very valuable fears.

76
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:26,373
I should know. I've lived
with them my entire life.

77
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:30,575
So have we all.

78
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,412
Good night, honey.

79
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:35,679
Good night, sweetheart.

80
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:00,737
Ready, set, go!

81
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:02,343
Come on, Gwenny! Come on!

82
00:04:02,378 --> 00:04:04,411
Let's go. Let's go.
Beat Daddy. Beat Daddy.

83
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:06,578
Go, go, go, go! Oh, yay!

84
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,920
- Yes!
- Aw, I lost.

85
00:04:09,286 --> 00:04:11,253
Whoo! Yes!

86
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:14,355
Whoo...

87
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:17,523
- Hey.
- Huh?

88
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:20,328
Hello!

89
00:04:20,363 --> 00:04:21,230
Huh?

90
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,509
Yay!

91
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:38,214
- Mine!
- You're the worst!

92
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:40,150
- That's mine!
- Got a thousand of 'em!

93
00:04:40,185 --> 00:04:41,921
- Whoa.
- Thanks, Dad!

94
00:04:41,956 --> 00:04:44,352
Whoa!

95
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,792
Okay, guys.

96
00:04:55,827 --> 00:04:57,827
Remember to pick
the fresh leaves.

97
00:04:57,862 --> 00:04:59,499
Okay, Dad.

98
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:00,830
Is this one good, Dad?

99
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:01,908
Perfect.

100
00:05:01,943 --> 00:05:04,009
Keep looking for more.

101
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,214
Guys!

102
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:12,545
Guys, you have to see something.

103
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,151
It's incredible.
Come on, come on.

104
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:16,318
Everybody, come. Come on.

105
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,998
Whoo! Oh, look!

106
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:28,231
- Oh, I told you.
- Yeah!

107
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:30,035
Isn't it beautiful?
This is awesome!

108
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,664
Oh! Have you ever seen
ducks like that?

109
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:45,347
Look at that.

110
00:05:45,382 --> 00:05:47,349
They must be migrating.

111
00:05:47,384 --> 00:05:48,922
Whoa.

112
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:51,881
They seem so mysterious
and exotic.

113
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,817
I wonder where
they flew in from.

114
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:55,060
Maybe we should go say hi.

115
00:05:55,095 --> 00:05:56,259
Should we?

116
00:05:56,294 --> 00:05:57,788
No. Oh, look at these feathers.

117
00:05:57,823 --> 00:05:59,130
No, I want to know.

118
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:01,066
Let's go ask 'em.
Mack, come on.

119
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:03,431
Yeah, no, I'm good.

120
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:04,696
Ugh. Come on.

121
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,665
We never meet anyone new.

122
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,634
Okay, fine.

123
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:12,671
All right, kids, let's go meet
Mom's new friends.

124
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,508
Kids?

125
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:17,214
Kids? Kids?

126
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:18,446
Pretty good progress, huh?

127
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:19,953
Yeah. Got to love a tailwind.

128
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:21,119
- Yeah.
- Oh.

129
00:06:21,154 --> 00:06:22,615
- Hello.
- Ah. Hello.

130
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,781
Welcome to the pond.

131
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:24,881
- Thank you.
- Hey there.

132
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,058
- Oh, hi.
- Nice feathers.

133
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:27,290
We shouldn't be here, Dax.

134
00:06:27,325 --> 00:06:28,995
- Shh!
- Dad is gonna be mad.

135
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,458
Go back to the parents, Gwen.

136
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:32,757
- Hey there.
- Dax!

137
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,099
What are you doing?

138
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:35,529
I don't want to be
psycho-killed!

139
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:37,762
- Let me go, you little feathery wart!
- Oh.

140
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,467
Okay, I'm a feathery wart?

141
00:06:39,502 --> 00:06:41,238
You don't even know me.

142
00:06:41,273 --> 00:06:43,306
No, no, no, no, no, no.
She's a feathery wart.

143
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:44,769
You're a very nice wart.

144
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,243
I-I mean wart duck.

145
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:47,772
- I mean...
- I'm kidding.

146
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,312
Oh. Right.

147
00:06:51,316 --> 00:06:53,217
Hi. I'm Kim.

148
00:06:53,252 --> 00:06:54,911
Hi. I'm Dax.

149
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:56,352
Welcome to Moosehead Pond.

150
00:06:56,387 --> 00:06:57,914
"Welcome to na-na-na."

151
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:00,356
You and your flock can stay
here as long as you like.

152
00:07:00,391 --> 00:07:02,061
- I could show you around.
- Hmm?

153
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:04,789
I mean, this is
pretty much it, but...

154
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,329
Mmm. Thanks.

155
00:07:06,364 --> 00:07:08,463
But we're just passing by
on our way down south.

156
00:07:08,498 --> 00:07:09,827
We're gonna spend
the winter there.

157
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:10,927
Where are you guys going?

158
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:12,269
We spend winter here

159
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:13,699
to avoid psycho killers
like your...

160
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,503
Sorry. Wart.

161
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:18,869
Wait. So you don't go anywhere
for the winter?

162
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:20,277
Uh, nope.

163
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:22,609
You should totally come with us.

164
00:07:22,644 --> 00:07:24,380
What? Really?

165
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,580
Yes! Your flock could
totally join ours.

166
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:28,351
Oh, my gosh,
this will be so cool.

167
00:07:28,386 --> 00:07:30,947
You will love migrating.
The sun, the sand.

168
00:07:30,982 --> 00:07:32,751
Wait. Do you like tropical food?

169
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,390
- What's your take on bananas?
- Oh. I don't...

170
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:35,820
Ah, you're gonna love 'em!

171
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,888
You hold this.
I'll go ask my dad.

172
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:39,098
Dad! Dad!

173
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:40,726
- What just happened?
- Dad!

174
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,959
I don't know,
but you're in trouble.

175
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:44,565
Dax! Gwen!

176
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,403
Are you crazy? You can't
just take off like that.

177
00:07:47,438 --> 00:07:49,702
- He made me do it!
- What?

178
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:51,968
And he talked to a girl.

179
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:53,574
- A girl?
- Gwen!

180
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:56,049
Yeah, and he told her
he wants to marry her.

181
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:58,150
What? I didn't say that!

182
00:07:58,185 --> 00:07:59,613
You said it with your eyes.

183
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:01,582
Dad, he's hitting me!
He's hitting me!

184
00:08:01,617 --> 00:08:03,122
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Enough! Enough!

185
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:05,751
- Sibling cruelty!
- Enough.

186
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,159
Okay. Hello.

187
00:08:07,194 --> 00:08:08,589
Hi. Hi. Big hellos.

188
00:08:08,624 --> 00:08:10,096
And we're good. Let's go.

189
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:11,493
- Mack.
- What? I said hi.

190
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:13,099
I smiled. I made eye contact.

191
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:14,661
I checked all the boxes.

192
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:15,827
Hey there.

193
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,994
I hear you want to join
our migration.

194
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:19,897
Sorry?

195
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,833
Oh, we're going back to Jamaica.

196
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,076
Have you ever been?

197
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:24,473
No.

198
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:26,541
Oh, it's just magical.

199
00:08:26,576 --> 00:08:29,005
I swear, there's even
a luminous lagoon

200
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,347
where the water glows.

201
00:08:30,382 --> 00:08:32,712
Oh, wow. Oh, I really
want to see that.

202
00:08:32,747 --> 00:08:34,516
Well, then it is settled.

203
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:36,518
Your whole flock can join us.

204
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:37,915
This is gonna be great.

205
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,389
Oh, gosh. That's...

206
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:40,984
That's just so nice of you.

207
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,590
Wait, wait, wait.

208
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,021
I think there's a slight
misunderstanding here.

209
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:47,364
Unfortunately,
we're just slammed this winter.

210
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,201
Aren't we, Pam?

211
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:51,203
'Cause we've got the thing,
and then the...

212
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:54,140
We got the thing after that.
So, you know what? We can't go.

213
00:08:54,175 --> 00:08:55,735
But you guys go.

214
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,110
Have a great time.

215
00:08:57,145 --> 00:09:00,509
And, you know, tell
the glowing water we said hi.

216
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,315
Uh, well, maybe next year, then?

217
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,383
You got it. Next year!

218
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:11,454
Uh, well, I guess
it's time for us to go.

219
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,427
Uh, have a nice trip.

220
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:19,891
Thanks.

221
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:22,597
Have a nice... pond.

222
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,707
I'm so sorry you can't
have babies with her.

223
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,848
That was so... rude!

224
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,047
I know.

225
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:45,785
"Have a nice pond."

226
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,017
Who says that?

227
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:48,425
That's just poor parenting.

228
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,394
Not them. You.

229
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:52,924
- Me?
- Yes, you.

230
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,993
Okay. So I got
a little carried away.

231
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,830
But migration?

232
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:59,238
What a stupid idea.

233
00:09:59,273 --> 00:10:01,537
- Ugh. Okay. You're impossible.
- Why?

234
00:10:01,572 --> 00:10:03,539
Because I found
a safe place for us to live

235
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:05,508
and we're happy here?

236
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:07,543
You mean you're happy here.

237
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:08,808
What?

238
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:11,349
I-I want us to get out
and see the world.

239
00:10:11,384 --> 00:10:12,779
- Me, too, Dad.
- Yeah.

240
00:10:12,814 --> 00:10:15,485
I want to go to Jamai...
Jam... J...

241
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,256
where they make jam.

242
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,720
You-you really want
those things?

243
00:10:19,755 --> 00:10:21,084
Yes.

244
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:23,361
- Really?
- Yes.

245
00:10:23,396 --> 00:10:24,527
No home improvements?

246
00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:26,155
- No!
- Yes.

247
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,025
I mean... I mean no.

248
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,467
D-Do you know what can happen
on a trip that long?

249
00:10:30,502 --> 00:10:31,864
What sort of father would I be

250
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,701
if I put my young fowl
in harm's way

251
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:36,935
for no reason except a chance
at a Caribbean vacation?

252
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,036
A father who knows
it's important for his kids

253
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,840
to see other parts of the world.

254
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,710
Mack, I don't want
to miss out on life

255
00:10:42,745 --> 00:10:45,009
because you're afraid
to leave this pond.

256
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,451
This isn't about migration.

257
00:10:47,486 --> 00:10:50,487
It's about adventure.

258
00:10:50,522 --> 00:10:53,655
Seeing what else
life has to offer.

259
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,053
Is that a little scary? Sure.

260
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,264
But isn't it worth it?

261
00:10:59,663 --> 00:11:01,157
No, Pam.

262
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:02,994
Not really.

263
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:10,474
You really need to open
your eyes, Mack,

264
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:13,378
before you miss it all.

265
00:11:13,413 --> 00:11:15,347
Come on, kids.

266
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,856
Hmm?

267
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:32,694
Huh? Huh?

268
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:36,192
Uncle Dan,
what are you doing here?

269
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:39,569
I don't know.

270
00:11:39,604 --> 00:11:42,440
I must have drifted
from my nest again.

271
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,642
Be a good boy
and get me back there.

272
00:11:46,677 --> 00:11:48,281
Give me a little push.

273
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:50,415
All right.

274
00:11:57,655 --> 00:11:59,721
Thank you.

275
00:11:59,756 --> 00:12:02,328
I heard the little family tiff.

276
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:04,396
I got to say...

277
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:05,925
you're right.

278
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,531
Wha... I am?

279
00:12:07,566 --> 00:12:08,730
Please.

280
00:12:08,765 --> 00:12:10,435
What's all the travel talk?

281
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,536
I mean,
why can't we be satisfied

282
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:14,406
with what we already have?

283
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:16,408
Well, yeah.

284
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:17,772
I mean, you got food right here.

285
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:20,203
We got a pond right here.
Right?

286
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:22,348
Yeah. Food, the pond.

287
00:12:22,383 --> 00:12:24,207
Why go anywhere else?

288
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:25,747
Stick to your beliefs, kid.

289
00:12:25,782 --> 00:12:28,486
- Don't change for anyone.
- Exactly.

290
00:12:28,521 --> 00:12:30,323
And you'll end up just like me.

291
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:32,116
- Happy.
- Yeah.

292
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,326
- Healthy.
- Yeah.

293
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:34,888
And totally alone!

294
00:12:34,923 --> 00:12:36,956
Yeah! Wait, what?

295
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,397
That's right.

296
00:12:38,432 --> 00:12:41,367
You'll be living the dream.

297
00:12:42,766 --> 00:12:44,601
Whoa, that was exhausting.

298
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:46,867
I'm gonna just rest here.

299
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:53,302
Rise and shine, Mallards!

300
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:54,710
We're burning daylight.

301
00:12:54,745 --> 00:12:56,272
Up and at 'em.

302
00:12:56,307 --> 00:12:57,647
Let's go, go, go!

303
00:12:57,682 --> 00:12:59,649
Here's breakfast.

304
00:12:59,684 --> 00:13:01,618
Dad, what are you doing?

305
00:13:01,653 --> 00:13:03,356
Getting your sorry feathers
out of bed.

306
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:05,248
Come on. We got to get ready.

307
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:07,558
Mack, ready for what?

308
00:13:07,593 --> 00:13:09,560
Nothing. Just, you know,

309
00:13:09,595 --> 00:13:13,465
for our big,
super fun family migration!

310
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,796
What?

311
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:16,996
Ha! Bet you didn't
see that coming.

312
00:13:17,031 --> 00:13:18,866
- Are-are you serious?
- Yep.

313
00:13:18,901 --> 00:13:22,331
An adventure into
the totally unknown.

314
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:24,036
And I'm gonna love it.

315
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:26,511
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. I-Is this real?

316
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:27,809
What do you mean,
"Is this real?"

317
00:13:27,844 --> 00:13:29,107
We're really going?

318
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,240
- Yes.
- On a migration?

319
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:31,648
- Mm-hmm.
- To Jamaica?

320
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:33,078
- Yeah.
- Together?

321
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:34,178
- Yes.
- Like, everyone?

322
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,620
- Yes.
- Including you?

323
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:38,622
Yes! We are all going
on a migration to Jamaica.

324
00:13:38,657 --> 00:13:40,283
In which language
should I tell you?

325
00:13:40,318 --> 00:13:42,560
Thanks, Dad.

326
00:13:43,354 --> 00:13:44,661
You're welcome.

327
00:13:44,696 --> 00:13:46,058
Oh!

328
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:49,193
I knew there was
some adventure left in you.

329
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,668
Wait, wait, wait!

330
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,039
Uncle Dan, you're coming, too!

331
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:01,645
- Gwen, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

332
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,207
We're going to Jamaica.

333
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,583
No. I don't think so, kiddo.

334
00:14:05,618 --> 00:14:07,519
Oh, please, Uncle Dan.

335
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:09,048
Nah.

336
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,346
Oh, too bad he doesn't want
to come, honey.

337
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:11,622
We tried. What else can we do?

338
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:13,052
Let's leave.

339
00:14:14,858 --> 00:14:17,386
Please...

340
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,541
Pretty please?

341
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:31,103
Whoa. That did it.

342
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:32,478
I can't refuse her.

343
00:14:32,513 --> 00:14:34,447
Look at her.
Look at how cute she is.

344
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:36,306
Yes! Uncle Dan is coming!

345
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:37,615
No, he's not.

346
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,078
Uncle Dan, Uncle Dan.

347
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:40,618
Uncle Dan, Uncle Dan...

348
00:14:40,653 --> 00:14:41,586
Oh, for real?

349
00:14:41,621 --> 00:14:43,148
Uncle Dan, Uncle Dan.

350
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:44,248
- Uncle Dan, that's me.
- Uncle Dan, Uncle Dan.

351
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,920
Yeah!

352
00:14:45,955 --> 00:14:47,592
Yay.

353
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:57,096
Here we go.
Let's do the final check.

354
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:59,098
Tail feather torsion?

355
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:00,132
Check.

356
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,035
Wing deployment?

357
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,234
Check.

358
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,940
Heads in takeoff mode?

359
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:07,139
Check.

360
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:10,076
Let's fly.

361
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:30,569
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

362
00:15:30,604 --> 00:15:33,429
Woo-hoo!

363
00:15:33,464 --> 00:15:35,970
Whoa! Whoo!

364
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,611
Yeah!

365
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:47,212
Okay, everyone,
enough fooling around.

366
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,280
"V" formation.

367
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,853
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

368
00:15:50,888 --> 00:15:52,690
- Look at me!
- Thanks, Dad!

369
00:15:52,725 --> 00:15:55,055
- Whoo!
- Yeah, this is awesome!

370
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,860
Well, better get used to it.

371
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,003
Huh. That's weird.

372
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:10,873
My inner compass may be
a little rusty,

373
00:16:10,908 --> 00:16:13,271
but I'm sure
we're heading south.

374
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,438
Yeah, we are, but why are we

375
00:16:15,473 --> 00:16:17,715
the only birds heading this way?

376
00:16:25,758 --> 00:16:27,516
Hey, kids, don't worry.

377
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:28,957
We're gonna be all right.

378
00:16:28,992 --> 00:16:30,596
Here we are together.

379
00:16:30,631 --> 00:16:32,092
We're on an adventure.

380
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:34,699
I promised adventure,
and this is exactly

381
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:36,701
what I promised, huh?

382
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,133
We're not gonna make it, are we?

383
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:42,234
- Uncle Dan!
- You can tell me. I don't mind.

384
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,610
I'm a big boy. I'm a big duck.

385
00:16:44,645 --> 00:16:46,744
No, Uncle Dan,
things are gonna be fine.

386
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:48,405
Isn't that right, Mack?

387
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,077
Uh, I, uh...

388
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:53,542
I mean yes, Mom's right.

389
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:55,346
This is fun.

390
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,481
This is the kind of thing we'll
remember for years to come.

391
00:16:58,516 --> 00:17:00,516
We'll look back and laugh.

392
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,406
- A heron.
- The one from Dad's story.

393
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,144
The ultimate duck killer.

394
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:25,750
Don't panic.

395
00:17:25,785 --> 00:17:28,786
Herons can't see
their prey if you stay still.

396
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:33,252
Hello, little ducks.

397
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:35,353
She's bluffing.

398
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:39,995
So, tell me, what's a nice
little family of mallards

399
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:43,636
doing down here
all cold and wet?

400
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:45,935
Nothing. We're good.

401
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,596
We're enjoying it.

402
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:49,840
But you must be freezing here.

403
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,105
- Oh, no, we're not.
- Come.

404
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,777
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- Come, come.

405
00:17:52,812 --> 00:17:56,715
Let Erin take care of you
in her comfy little nest.

406
00:18:01,018 --> 00:18:02,721
In you go. Hup, hup, hup.

407
00:18:02,756 --> 00:18:04,580
Harry!

408
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:06,252
Harry, look.

409
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:07,517
Look what I found.

410
00:18:07,552 --> 00:18:12,357
A nice little family
of traveling mallards.

411
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:14,997
Mallards.

412
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,707
Uh, okay. Nice meeting you all.

413
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:22,873
Bye-bye.

414
00:18:22,908 --> 00:18:25,777
In a rush, are you?

415
00:18:25,812 --> 00:18:27,570
Oh, we don't want
to be a bother.

416
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:30,749
You look busy decaying.

417
00:18:30,784 --> 00:18:33,378
You're not bothering at all.

418
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:36,821
But maybe herons are not

419
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:40,825
good enough for you, mallards?

420
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,321
No, of course not.

421
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:45,357
We're happy to stay.

422
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:50,032
Good!
Let me get your bed ready.

423
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:52,529
What do they do,
rip you apart, then eat you?

424
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,201
Dan.

425
00:18:54,236 --> 00:18:55,708
I don't know how they do it.
What's the method?

426
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:57,501
Hey. Zip it.

427
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,811
Wake me up when it's
my turn to be eaten.

428
00:18:59,846 --> 00:19:01,637
- What?
- What are you doing, Pam?

429
00:19:01,672 --> 00:19:03,782
Well, I don't know. I just...
I don't want to offend them.

430
00:19:03,817 --> 00:19:05,113
Can't you see
they want to eat us?

431
00:19:05,148 --> 00:19:06,609
I don't want to be eaten!

432
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:07,786
Well, she can't eat us.

433
00:19:07,821 --> 00:19:09,183
She doesn't have teeth.

434
00:19:09,218 --> 00:19:10,954
Well, what if she cuts us
into pieces first?

435
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:12,681
I don't want to be cut
into piece...

436
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:14,188
I-I-I beg your pardon?

437
00:19:14,223 --> 00:19:15,959
Oh, what's that? No, no.

438
00:19:15,994 --> 00:19:18,995
We were just saying
your nest is just so charming.

439
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,766
Weren't we, kids?

440
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:22,801
Oh, thank you.

441
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:25,067
We moved here a few years ago.

442
00:19:25,102 --> 00:19:27,971
We used to migrate
all the time like you.

443
00:19:28,006 --> 00:19:30,941
Harry was such an adventurer.

444
00:19:30,976 --> 00:19:32,602
Fierce predator, too.

445
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:36,815
He could catch any prey
with a single swift peck.

446
00:19:45,254 --> 00:19:48,959
Those were the good old days.

447
00:19:48,994 --> 00:19:51,456
Now Harry's too old.

448
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:56,967
I'm the one who brings food
back to the nest.

449
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,665
But, anyway,
you must be exhausted.

450
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,139
Here's your bed.

451
00:20:05,307 --> 00:20:07,142
There's no way
we're sleeping in that.

452
00:20:07,177 --> 00:20:09,914
But it's our finest bed.

453
00:20:09,949 --> 00:20:11,443
And it is perfect.

454
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:13,313
Thank you.

455
00:20:13,348 --> 00:20:15,018
Wow, huh?

456
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:18,285
Hey, feel this.
Even comfier than our own nest.

457
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,990
Yeah, sure.

458
00:20:20,025 --> 00:20:22,289
It's greasier, too. Oh!

459
00:20:23,424 --> 00:20:26,755
Looks like your last guest
is still here.

460
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,724
And dead.

461
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:30,660
Thank you.

462
00:20:30,695 --> 00:20:32,904
You're welcome, sweethearts.

463
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:34,235
Sleep tight.

464
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,810
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

465
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:52,220
Okay. Storm is over.

466
00:20:52,255 --> 00:20:54,222
Let's go. Kids, kids, wake up.

467
00:20:54,257 --> 00:20:55,960
- Pam, we got to go right now.
- What?

468
00:20:55,995 --> 00:20:57,324
- Right now!
- Now?

469
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:59,194
- What about Uncle Dan?
- It's fine.

470
00:20:59,229 --> 00:21:00,690
When they wake up,
they'll eat him.

471
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:02,527
That'll give us more time
to lose...

472
00:21:04,102 --> 00:21:05,596
You're awake.

473
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,697
Looking right at us, too.

474
00:21:07,732 --> 00:21:09,600
- Bonus.
- Shh!

475
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:14,176
You shouldn't have gotten
out of your beds.

476
00:21:14,211 --> 00:21:18,675
Nighttime is when
predators like to feed.

477
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,281
Stay away from my kids.

478
00:21:20,316 --> 00:21:22,855
Let's do this quick!

479
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,615
Run, kids, run!

480
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,891
Let me get them!

481
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:30,456
Harry, catch them!

482
00:21:31,998 --> 00:21:34,361
Head for the door!

483
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,434
Go, go!

484
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,636
Hands off!

485
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:48,771
It's okay, kids.

486
00:21:48,806 --> 00:21:50,575
Just hold still.

487
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,884
No, no, no, no, no.

488
00:21:53,217 --> 00:21:54,381
Please don't eat us.

489
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,921
We haven't finished molting yet.

490
00:21:55,956 --> 00:21:57,285
Pretty please?

491
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,057
I promise you this won't hurt.

492
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:08,032
No!

493
00:22:09,563 --> 00:22:11,002
Gotcha!

494
00:22:11,037 --> 00:22:14,632
He was about to gulp you
in one bite.

495
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:15,831
Bad fish.

496
00:22:15,866 --> 00:22:18,636
Ooh, bad fish!

497
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,508
You... you saved them?

498
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:24,015
Oh.

499
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,511
It was nothing.

500
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:28,448
And we have breakfast
for tomorrow.

501
00:22:28,483 --> 00:22:30,450
Right, Harry?

502
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:34,883
Into beddy-byes now.

503
00:22:54,146 --> 00:22:56,113
Are you sure
you have to go already?

504
00:22:56,148 --> 00:22:59,116
I'll miss your kids so much.

505
00:22:59,151 --> 00:23:01,052
They are so adorable.

506
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,486
Mmm. And you taste so good.

507
00:23:06,521 --> 00:23:09,786
- Maybe I'll eat you.
- Uh...

508
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,260
I'm kidding.

509
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:16,430
- Or am I?
- Huh?

510
00:23:17,334 --> 00:23:19,136
- It's a joke!
- Oh.

511
00:23:19,171 --> 00:23:21,534
It's a joke.

512
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:22,799
So funny.

513
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,471
All right.

514
00:23:24,506 --> 00:23:26,869
Time to go.
Thanks for everything.

515
00:23:26,904 --> 00:23:29,014
Oh, goodbye.

516
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:30,543
Uh, I haven't kissed
Harry goodbye!

517
00:23:30,578 --> 00:23:32,578
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Blow him a kiss.

518
00:23:32,613 --> 00:23:34,415
Mwah. Mwah.

519
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,285
No, no, no, no,
you don't have to walk closer.

520
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,814
You're good there. Bye, Harry.

521
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,288
Thanks so much. Mwah.

522
00:23:39,323 --> 00:23:43,292
Don't forget,
drop by on your way back.

523
00:23:44,097 --> 00:23:45,855
Whew.

524
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,164
Wild night there, huh?

525
00:23:47,199 --> 00:23:49,892
Yeah.

526
00:23:49,927 --> 00:23:51,366
Yeah.

527
00:23:51,401 --> 00:23:52,862
How about when she pulled out
that pan, though?

528
00:23:52,897 --> 00:23:55,931
Oh, my gosh! With the dead fish
still in the pan?

529
00:23:55,966 --> 00:23:57,438
- The dead fish.
- Terrifying.

530
00:23:57,473 --> 00:23:59,704
Right? Still, lovely birds.

531
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:01,706
Oh, lovely.

532
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:03,444
Lovely birds.

533
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,777
Guys! Come up!

534
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,747
You have to see this.

535
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,584
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.

536
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:14,389
Dax, let's keep the adventure
where I can see you.

537
00:24:25,996 --> 00:24:27,963
Whoa!

538
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:32,209
Woo-hoo! Come on!

539
00:24:32,244 --> 00:24:33,474
Try it, Dad!

540
00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:35,410
Okay, okay, this is pretty cool,

541
00:24:35,445 --> 00:24:37,148
but we should probably
get back on...

542
00:24:38,547 --> 00:24:41,185
Don't be such
a stick-in-the-mud.

543
00:24:48,095 --> 00:24:51,591
Woo-hoo!

544
00:24:51,626 --> 00:24:52,955
Whoa!

545
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,071
Ah, yeah!

546
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:01,029
Woo-hoo!

547
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:02,701
Hello!

548
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,936
- Peekaboo!
- Whoa! Dad!

549
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,519
Ow. Hey, watch out.

550
00:25:18,554 --> 00:25:20,224
Hey!

551
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:23,986
Aha! Whoo!

552
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:26,263
Gotcha! Whoo!

553
00:25:26,298 --> 00:25:28,529
That was fun.

554
00:25:28,564 --> 00:25:30,399
Let's go down
before we lose our way.

555
00:25:30,434 --> 00:25:32,027
Please, Dad, come on.

556
00:25:32,062 --> 00:25:33,567
- Just a bit more.
- Please, Dad?

557
00:25:33,602 --> 00:25:36,867
Okay, okay,
just a little bit longer.

558
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,869
What is that?

559
00:27:03,263 --> 00:27:06,231
Whoa!

560
00:27:10,336 --> 00:27:12,798
Guys, you okay?

561
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,602
Yeah! What a ride.

562
00:27:14,637 --> 00:27:16,307
Let's do it again.

563
00:27:16,342 --> 00:27:17,737
Yeah!

564
00:27:17,772 --> 00:27:19,475
Your mother.

565
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,070
Where's your mother?

566
00:27:21,105 --> 00:27:22,709
Pam?

567
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:26,284
That is not your mother.

568
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,286
Up here! Fly up.

569
00:27:28,321 --> 00:27:30,387
We can see so much better
from up here.

570
00:27:30,422 --> 00:27:31,916
- Pam! Are you hurt somewhere?
- Oh! What?

571
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:33,753
- Do you feel pain?
- I-I'm fine.

572
00:27:33,788 --> 00:27:35,458
What's your name? How many
feathers am I holding up?

573
00:27:35,493 --> 00:27:37,427
Hey. I'm fine.

574
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:41,596
Thank goodness.

575
00:27:41,631 --> 00:27:43,125
Okay. Come on, everyone.

576
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,469
Prepare for takeoff
so we can get out of...

577
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:49,769
...here.

578
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:52,310
What is this place?

579
00:27:52,345 --> 00:27:53,905
I... I don't know.

580
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,709
We've never been
this far before.

581
00:27:55,744 --> 00:27:59,009
Uncle Dan, have you ever
been here before?

582
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,615
Uncle Dan?

583
00:28:01,453 --> 00:28:03,915
Hello? Guys?

584
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,620
Anyone?

585
00:28:05,655 --> 00:28:07,886
I don't like heights.

586
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:16,862
Oh, whoa!

587
00:28:16,897 --> 00:28:18,930
Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

588
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,230
Uncle Dan?

589
00:28:22,265 --> 00:28:23,473
Yeah, it's me!

590
00:28:23,508 --> 00:28:24,903
It's Uncle Dan!

591
00:28:24,938 --> 00:28:28,071
Uncle Dan!

592
00:28:29,239 --> 00:28:31,239
Well, he led a good life.

593
00:28:31,274 --> 00:28:32,812
What?

594
00:28:32,847 --> 00:28:34,781
We're coming for you, Uncle Dan!

595
00:28:34,816 --> 00:28:36,783
He would have wanted us
to go on without him.

596
00:28:36,818 --> 00:28:40,215
Come on, he was kind like that.

597
00:28:56,266 --> 00:28:57,672
Ow!

598
00:28:58,741 --> 00:29:01,445
Oh. Well, hello there.

599
00:29:03,482 --> 00:29:06,384
Ah...

600
00:29:13,954 --> 00:29:15,151
Get away, get away!

601
00:29:17,254 --> 00:29:19,287
Pigeons.

602
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:21,124
Mmm.

603
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,532
Ah...

604
00:29:24,327 --> 00:29:27,999
Uncle Dan!
Uncle Dan!

605
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,639
- Uncle Dan!
- Uncle Dan!

606
00:29:30,674 --> 00:29:32,300
- Uncle Dan, where are you?
- Uncle Dan!

607
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:33,543
Uncle Dan?

608
00:29:33,578 --> 00:29:35,006
What if something ate Uncle Dan?

609
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,975
Honey, I promise you,
nothing would ever

610
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,383
want to eat Uncle Dan.

611
00:29:38,418 --> 00:29:40,550
Uncle Dan.

612
00:29:40,585 --> 00:29:42,849
Get off me!

613
00:29:42,884 --> 00:29:45,247
I'm coming!

614
00:29:45,282 --> 00:29:47,821
Hey, wait! Wait!

615
00:29:47,856 --> 00:29:49,559
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

616
00:29:49,594 --> 00:29:51,495
It's my sandwich.

617
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,958
I licked it, I licked it!

618
00:29:52,993 --> 00:29:54,531
You can't touch it
with duck spit on it.

619
00:29:54,566 --> 00:29:55,697
Uncle Dan!

620
00:29:55,732 --> 00:29:57,831
Get your wings off my uncle!

621
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:00,570
Dax, Gwen, wait!

622
00:30:00,605 --> 00:30:01,868
Stay away from my family!

623
00:30:01,903 --> 00:30:03,738
Back away!
Back away! Back away!

624
00:30:03,773 --> 00:30:06,939
Get out of here,
you trashy, trashy vermin!

625
00:30:10,274 --> 00:30:12,846
Who said that?

626
00:30:15,048 --> 00:30:20,150
I asked, "Who said that?"

627
00:30:23,353 --> 00:30:25,364
Huh?

628
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,036
Come here, bumpkin.

629
00:30:38,071 --> 00:30:40,335
Uh... Oh.

630
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,177
Say it again.

631
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,113
Uh, which part?

632
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:52,919
"Trashy, trashy vermin."

633
00:30:52,954 --> 00:30:56,021
Let the record reflect I just
meant to say "trashy vermin."

634
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:59,057
Which I'm not saying
that's good,

635
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:02,434
but I wasn't doubling down
on "trashy," vermin.

636
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:06,900
You ducks make me sick,
you know that?

637
00:31:07,936 --> 00:31:10,871
You're fed all day
by the humans in the park,

638
00:31:10,906 --> 00:31:12,675
but that's not enough for you.

639
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,006
No, no, no.

640
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:16,580
You got to come
to our territory.

641
00:31:16,615 --> 00:31:18,615
You got to steal our food.

642
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,947
And then you insult us?

643
00:31:20,982 --> 00:31:22,487
What? No, no, no, no,
I wasn't...

644
00:31:22,522 --> 00:31:24,115
- Name!
- Uh, Mack.

645
00:31:25,723 --> 00:31:29,494
Well, "Uh, Mack," I'm the Chump,

646
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:33,157
and I'm the leader of
this group of hardworking birds

647
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:34,895
you just called vermin.

648
00:31:37,702 --> 00:31:39,295
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

649
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,769
So listen, Chump...

650
00:31:40,804 --> 00:31:42,100
What did you just call me?

651
00:31:42,135 --> 00:31:44,069
Sorry.
I thought your name was Chump.

652
00:31:44,104 --> 00:31:45,609
Yeah, Chump, yeah.
That's my name. Why?

653
00:31:45,644 --> 00:31:47,072
Right. So listen, Chump...

654
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:48,843
- What did you just call me?!
- I'm sorry.

655
00:31:48,878 --> 00:31:51,373
Is everyone else
hearing "Chump" or...

656
00:31:51,408 --> 00:31:52,880
- What did... What?
- Okay, okay.

657
00:31:52,915 --> 00:31:55,520
I think there's a slight
misunderstanding here.

658
00:31:55,555 --> 00:31:56,884
Excuse me. Will you excuse me?

659
00:31:56,919 --> 00:31:58,380
Coming through.
Uh-huh. Thank you.

660
00:31:58,415 --> 00:32:00,448
Okay. Hi there. I'm Pam.

661
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:02,791
I'm sharing my life with him,
so I'm painfully aware

662
00:32:02,826 --> 00:32:05,189
of all the stupid things
that come out of his mouth.

663
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:06,388
Hmm?

664
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:07,796
Oh, yeah, that's true. She is.

665
00:32:07,831 --> 00:32:10,634
But I assure you,
he meant no harm.

666
00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:12,031
And to show our gratitude

667
00:32:12,066 --> 00:32:13,604
for your understanding
in this matter,

668
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:17,707
how about we share
the sandwich 50-50?

669
00:32:21,845 --> 00:32:24,615
- 80-20.
- 60-40.

670
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,474
- 70-30.
- 65-35.

671
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:29,114
- 68-32!
- 67-33!

672
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,754
You got yourself a deal.

673
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:33,888
Uncle Dan, cut the sandwich.

674
00:32:33,923 --> 00:32:35,560
Uh...

675
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,091
You don't want to try
50-50 again?

676
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:41,665
- Uncle Dan!
- All right, all right.

677
00:32:46,067 --> 00:32:47,495
You, I like.

678
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,068
Thank you, Chump.

679
00:32:49,103 --> 00:32:51,301
Sorry for busting your bills
over here, but, uh...

680
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:54,678
sometimes
I get sensitive, is all.

681
00:32:54,713 --> 00:32:56,548
Us pigeons,
we got big hearts, too.

682
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:57,912
Ain't that right, guys?

683
00:32:57,947 --> 00:32:59,914
Oh, for sure.

684
00:32:59,949 --> 00:33:02,653
- We just want to be loved.
- And respected.

685
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:05,722
Yeah.

686
00:33:05,757 --> 00:33:08,857
So anything you need...
I mean anything...

687
00:33:08,892 --> 00:33:10,320
Chump's got ya.

688
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,026
Oh, really?
Because we are completely lost.

689
00:33:13,061 --> 00:33:14,731
We're trying to get to Jamaica.

690
00:33:14,766 --> 00:33:16,458
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's in Queens, right?

691
00:33:16,493 --> 00:33:17,800
Uh, more south.

692
00:33:17,835 --> 00:33:19,329
Uh, like, the Caribbean.

693
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,529
Oh, that Jamaica.

694
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:23,036
I got a buddy
who knows that place

695
00:33:23,071 --> 00:33:24,642
like the back of his wing.

696
00:33:24,677 --> 00:33:27,106
You-you think he'll help us?

697
00:33:27,141 --> 00:33:29,944
Yeah. I mean, it's a bit
of a sore subject for him,

698
00:33:29,979 --> 00:33:32,243
but, uh, I'm sure
it won't be a problem.

699
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:34,586
Come on, lovebirds,
we ain't got all day.

700
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:35,917
It's this way.

701
00:33:35,952 --> 00:33:39,052
Wow. Mom, you rock.

702
00:33:39,087 --> 00:33:40,020
Yeah.

703
00:33:40,055 --> 00:33:42,484
- 60-40!
- 70-30!

704
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:44,057
60,000-3,500!

705
00:33:44,092 --> 00:33:46,389
I didn't know
you could be so tough.

706
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:49,062
Really, Mack?!
You didn't know that?

707
00:33:49,097 --> 00:33:50,525
Oh, no, I...

708
00:33:52,067 --> 00:33:52,967
Oh!

709
00:33:53,002 --> 00:33:54,529
I get it.

710
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:56,333
That's good.

711
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:57,807
That's very good.

712
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:01,976
Okay, my little bumpkins,

713
00:34:02,011 --> 00:34:03,780
- let's get a move on.
Whoa.

714
00:34:03,815 --> 00:34:05,683
Are you kidding?
We are not flying through

715
00:34:05,718 --> 00:34:07,916
this crazy death trap
of a city again.

716
00:34:07,951 --> 00:34:09,918
Oh, come on. It's nothing.

717
00:34:09,953 --> 00:34:11,623
Just stick close to me,

718
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:14,153
and everything
will be all right.

719
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,898
I'm okay. Yeah, no, I'm okay!

720
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,198
Yeah.

721
00:34:27,597 --> 00:34:29,432
I'm okay.

722
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:30,774
I'm still okay.

723
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:32,270
We can do this.

724
00:34:32,305 --> 00:34:33,535
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

725
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,779
Ha-ha! You missed, bus!

726
00:34:40,544 --> 00:34:42,753
Maybe don't stick too close.

727
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:56,767
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

728
00:35:04,172 --> 00:35:05,809
Aw.

729
00:35:05,844 --> 00:35:07,569
Here you go, my little princess.

730
00:35:07,604 --> 00:35:09,472
Thank you!

731
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:10,814
Woo-hoo!

732
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:13,113
Whoa, Gwen! I got you, Gwen.

733
00:35:13,148 --> 00:35:15,148
I got you.

734
00:35:15,183 --> 00:35:17,755
Look! Look, there it is.

735
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,087
That's Jamaica.

736
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,796
What?

737
00:35:42,243 --> 00:35:43,847
Here we are.

738
00:35:43,882 --> 00:35:46,311
Okay, so...

739
00:35:46,346 --> 00:35:48,786
Wait, where's our guy?

740
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:51,580
And what is that?

741
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:53,549
Huh? Oh, that?

742
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,551
Don't worry about it.

743
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:57,553
But I should probably warn you,

744
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:00,391
Delroy's owner is a chef.

745
00:36:00,426 --> 00:36:01,799
A-A chef?

746
00:36:01,834 --> 00:36:03,295
Yeah. A-A chef.

747
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,902
Like a predator
except instead of eating you,

748
00:36:05,937 --> 00:36:08,498
he feeds you to a group
of much lazier predators.

749
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,434
Right this way.

750
00:36:18,213 --> 00:36:19,982
After you.

751
00:36:31,424 --> 00:36:32,764
Hey. Shh!

752
00:36:38,398 --> 00:36:39,628
Coast is clear.

753
00:36:40,873 --> 00:36:42,939
Hey, Delroy.

754
00:36:42,974 --> 00:36:44,908
How's it going?
It's been a while.

755
00:36:44,943 --> 00:36:46,877
You look good.
Slip me some feather.

756
00:36:46,912 --> 00:36:48,813
I brought you
a nice family of mallards.

757
00:36:48,848 --> 00:36:50,815
They need to ask you something.

758
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:58,515
Oh. Well, Mr. Delroy,

759
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,221
so nice to meet you.

760
00:37:01,256 --> 00:37:03,894
Do you know the way to Jamaica?

761
00:37:05,722 --> 00:37:08,624
Do I know the way to Jamaica?

762
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:09,966
Told ya.

763
00:37:10,001 --> 00:37:11,231
He's a little sensitive
about it.

764
00:37:11,266 --> 00:37:13,530
He was born and raised there.

765
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,070
What happened?

766
00:37:15,105 --> 00:37:17,765
The chef snatched him up
in the middle of the night.

767
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,703
Next day, old Del's gone
from free bird to jailbird.

768
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:23,012
Come on, D.

769
00:37:23,047 --> 00:37:25,113
Just tell them how to get there.

770
00:37:27,447 --> 00:37:30,250
Fly to the big green statue,
fly due south for three miles,

771
00:37:30,285 --> 00:37:33,055
then due east for one mile,
due west for ten miles,

772
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,386
then you southwest for one mile,

773
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:36,025
- south-southeast for two miles...
- Uh...

774
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,555
...and south-southwest
for the rest of the way.

775
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,591
And don't stop
until you see that mist

776
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:45,969
dancing atop
the beautiful blue mountains.

777
00:37:46,004 --> 00:37:49,071
You can't miss it.

778
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:54,703
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
No, don't cry, Big Red.

779
00:37:54,738 --> 00:37:57,013
It's all right.
We didn't mean to upset you.

780
00:37:57,048 --> 00:38:00,016
Jamaica!

781
00:38:01,987 --> 00:38:03,811
I miss my family.

782
00:38:03,846 --> 00:38:05,021
Devon.

783
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,649
And likkle Donnie.

784
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:09,190
Dolores. Deedee.

785
00:38:09,225 --> 00:38:12,391
Winston!

786
00:38:12,426 --> 00:38:13,931
That me cousin.

787
00:38:13,966 --> 00:38:18,034
Dad, we're not really gonna
leave him here, are we?

788
00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:21,037
He looks so cramped
in that cage.

789
00:38:21,072 --> 00:38:22,731
Come on, blow it out.

790
00:38:22,766 --> 00:38:24,876
Blow.

791
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:28,638
There's nothing
we can do here, Dax.

792
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,244
We could get the key.

793
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:32,807
No, kid. That's impossible.

794
00:38:32,842 --> 00:38:34,644
Why? Where is it?

795
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,712
Down there.

796
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:39,220
The chef keeps that key
on him at all times.

797
00:38:39,255 --> 00:38:41,783
And trust me,
you don't want to go

798
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:43,994
anywhere near that lunatic.

799
00:38:44,029 --> 00:38:48,823
Him catch ya, him turn you
into duck à l'orange.

800
00:38:48,858 --> 00:38:50,495
What's duck à l'orange?

801
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:53,861
It's you with l'orange on top.

802
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:57,535
You know what?
Guys, don't worry.

803
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,911
- I'll go get it.
- Uh, what? No, no, no, no, no.

804
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:01,308
Dad, it's okay. I've got this.

805
00:39:01,343 --> 00:39:03,079
No, you don't got this.

806
00:39:03,114 --> 00:39:05,708
But just because you're scared
of everything in the world

807
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:07,611
doesn't mean I have to be.

808
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,319
Okay. You know what?

809
00:39:12,354 --> 00:39:13,925
I will go get the key.

810
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,388
Cool. I'm coming with you.

811
00:39:15,423 --> 00:39:17,258
- No. You stay.
- Dad!

812
00:39:17,293 --> 00:39:20,228
Ah-ah-ah. Stay here.

813
00:40:08,641 --> 00:40:10,014
Hmm?

814
00:40:13,646 --> 00:40:14,711
Huh?

815
00:41:03,102 --> 00:41:04,992
How's it going?

816
00:41:05,027 --> 00:41:06,862
Shh! What are you doing here?

817
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,633
I told you to stay back there.

818
00:41:08,668 --> 00:41:10,767
Oh, there's no way I'm
letting you have all the fun.

819
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,043
Let's go.

820
00:41:18,216 --> 00:41:20,051
There.

821
00:41:20,086 --> 00:41:21,382
Here.

822
00:41:21,417 --> 00:41:23,054
Grab my tail
so I can get the key.

823
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:24,682
Hurry.

824
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:38,597
- Pam.
- Almost there.

825
00:41:38,632 --> 00:41:39,631
Look.

826
00:41:41,602 --> 00:41:44,207
- Pam.
- Almost there.

827
00:41:46,508 --> 00:41:48,541
- Pam.
- A little closer.

828
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:50,543
Pam!

829
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:52,776

- Here.

872
00:44:35,578 --> 00:44:37,380
Okay. Let's do this.

873
00:44:37,415 --> 00:44:38,810
Hurry! Hurry!

874
00:44:38,845 --> 00:44:40,383
No, more to the right.
To the right, and twist.

875
00:44:40,418 --> 00:44:41,615
No, no, no, no, no.
My right, Dad.

876
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:42,913
- Mack! -Down, down.
- No, push.

877
00:44:42,948 --> 00:44:44,420
- No, to the right.
- That's it!

878
00:44:44,455 --> 00:44:45,619
- Now, hold it and twist it.
- No, Dad.

879
00:44:45,654 --> 00:44:46,653
- Come on!
- Do I just have to do it?

880
00:44:46,688 --> 00:44:47,885
Push!

881
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,359
Oh. What happened?

882
00:44:50,824 --> 00:44:53,396
Wait, wh-where's the k...
Where's the key?

883
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:55,266
- I swallowed it.
- Oh, that's a bummer.

884
00:44:55,301 --> 00:44:57,125
Spit it out.
You need to spit it out!

885
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,500
I'm on it. I'm on it.

886
00:44:58,535 --> 00:45:00,865
Come on, Mack.

887
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,231
Okay, he's really close,
and he really looks mad.

888
00:45:06,741 --> 00:45:08,279
Mack!

889
00:45:08,314 --> 00:45:11,348
- Spit it out already.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

890
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:15,616
Come on! Hurry up!

891
00:45:18,687 --> 00:45:20,687

893
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:24,119
Spit it out!

894
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,890
This isn't working!

895
00:45:25,925 --> 00:45:29,157

00:46:49,008 --> 00:46:51,239
We did it!

902
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,456
Thank you!

903
00:47:01,658 --> 00:47:03,559
Whoo! Oh, you did it.

904
00:47:03,594 --> 00:47:04,824
I can't believe it.

905
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:07,123
I was in a cage,
and now I'm not.

906
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,630
In, and now not.

907
00:47:08,665 --> 00:47:10,863
And you did it!

908
00:47:10,898 --> 00:47:12,128
All of you.

909
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,767
But you...

910
00:47:13,802 --> 00:47:15,802
you wild duck, you.

911
00:47:15,837 --> 00:47:18,134
You must be the bravest duck
me ever meet.

912
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:19,476
Oh, I'm not that...

913
00:47:20,908 --> 00:47:22,138
I'm not that brave.

914
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:23,612
What?! You knew the danger.

915
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,746
You did it anyway.
What do you call that?

916
00:47:25,781 --> 00:47:27,308
Yeah, you're right.

917
00:47:27,343 --> 00:47:30,916
I guess that is the only word
that describes who I am.

918
00:47:30,951 --> 00:47:33,589
Did you hear that?
He called me brave.

919
00:47:33,624 --> 00:47:35,558
So you want to go
to my island, eh?

920
00:47:35,593 --> 00:47:37,824
I will be honored
to take you there myself.

921
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:39,628
You'd do that?

922
00:47:39,663 --> 00:47:42,323
For you, me do anything,

923
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:46,360
because I can do anything!

924
00:47:46,395 --> 00:47:47,669
Woo-hoo!

925
00:47:47,704 --> 00:47:50,397
I can go here,
or I could go here.

926
00:47:50,432 --> 00:47:52,509
Free as a bird!

927
00:47:52,544 --> 00:47:53,774
Right.

928
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:57,481
'Cause I'm a bird!

929
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,914
I didn't think
I'd ever say this, but, uh,

930
00:48:01,949 --> 00:48:04,818
you are one heck of a bird.

931
00:48:04,853 --> 00:48:06,985
Oh. Well, thanks, Chump.

932
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,559
You're not so bad yourself.

933
00:48:11,354 --> 00:48:13,695
Yeah, you know, I'm getting
a little waterwork-y up here.

934
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:15,697
Scram, you crazy ducks.

935
00:48:15,732 --> 00:48:17,325
Get out of here.

936
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,700
- Bye, Chump.
- Bye-bye, Chump.

937
00:48:18,735 --> 00:48:20,163
- Bye, Chump.
- Thank you!

938
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:21,428
Thanks for everything.

939
00:48:21,463 --> 00:48:23,001
So long, Chump.

940
00:48:23,036 --> 00:48:26,037
Don't forget
where you got that sandwich.

941
00:48:29,515 --> 00:48:31,515
Bye-bye, you country bumpkins.

942
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:33,407
I love you.

943
00:48:54,133 --> 00:48:55,836
I can't believe it!

944
00:48:55,871 --> 00:48:57,904
In a few hours,
we'll reach the coast.

945
00:48:57,939 --> 00:48:59,741
Then a little hop
over the ocean,

946
00:48:59,776 --> 00:49:02,744
and we'll finally get
to my homeland!

947
00:49:02,779 --> 00:49:05,175
Hey, uh, Delroy, uh, is it true

948
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:08,277
that the sea glows at night
in Jamaica?

949
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:11,786
Because that sounds
incredibly magical.

950
00:49:11,821 --> 00:49:13,524
Ah.

951
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:15,119
You hear about that, eh?

952
00:49:15,154 --> 00:49:18,089
Whatever you're expecting
over there...

953
00:49:18,124 --> 00:49:21,158
it's going to be even better.

954
00:49:22,568 --> 00:49:26,196
Jamaica, I'm coming home!

955
00:49:26,231 --> 00:49:28,737
- ♪ I'm coming, I'm coming ♪
- Mom?

956
00:49:28,772 --> 00:49:30,739
- ♪ I'm coming home. ♪
- Hmm?

957
00:49:32,138 --> 00:49:33,269
It's really bad.

958
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:34,908
Oh. It's okay, Gwen.

959
00:49:34,943 --> 00:49:36,547
You can do it while we fly.

960
00:49:36,582 --> 00:49:38,747
Here? But anyone could see me.

961
00:49:38,782 --> 00:49:40,474
No one's watching, Gwen.

962
00:49:40,509 --> 00:49:42,377
You know what?
I'll go up front.

963
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:44,346
What's happening?

964
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:45,886
We have a number two situation.

965
00:49:45,921 --> 00:49:47,184
Oh.

966
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:48,856
- Everything okay back there?
- Dad! Don't look!

967
00:49:48,891 --> 00:49:50,385
- Oh! Sorry, Gwen.
- What are you doing?

968
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,925
My bad. My bad.

969
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,224
Mom, I can't do it here.

970
00:49:54,259 --> 00:49:55,566
Can we land?

971
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:56,930
No, we won't land, Gwen.

972
00:49:56,965 --> 00:49:58,525
You're old enough
to do it in the sky now.

973
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,770
But it's too much pressure,
and it's gross.

974
00:50:01,805 --> 00:50:03,673
It's not gross. We're birds.

975
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:05,334
Every bird does it in the sky.

976
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,435
What if someone is looking
down there?

977
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,041
No one is looking down there.

978
00:50:09,076 --> 00:50:10,713
I told you, we are not landing.

979
00:50:10,748 --> 00:50:12,847
There is no way we're landing.

980
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,850
Are you sure no one's watching?

981
00:50:15,885 --> 00:50:17,049
Gwen Mallard!

982
00:50:17,084 --> 00:50:18,787
Do it now
or we leave without you.

983
00:50:18,822 --> 00:50:20,514
- Okay, okay.
- Ugh!

984
00:50:20,549 --> 00:50:22,087
She's perfectly capable of
doing her business in the sky,

985
00:50:22,122 --> 00:50:23,484
- and yet here we are.
- It's okay, Pam.

986
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:24,826
Just let her be.

987
00:50:24,861 --> 00:50:26,520
Does anybody have a soft moss?

988
00:50:26,555 --> 00:50:28,423
Just use a leaf!

989
00:50:29,998 --> 00:50:31,800
Someone's watching!
Someone's watching!

990
00:50:31,835 --> 00:50:34,165
- There! Someone's watching!
- Where? Where?

991
00:50:37,137 --> 00:50:38,565
Huh.

992
00:50:47,609 --> 00:50:48,982
Hmm.

993
00:50:49,017 --> 00:50:51,952
Follow me, and stay close.

994
00:50:51,987 --> 00:50:53,888
Whoa! For real, Dad?

995
00:50:54,726 --> 00:50:56,022
Mm-hmm.

996
00:50:56,057 --> 00:50:56,990
Cool.

997
00:50:57,025 --> 00:50:58,695
I like your spirit, duck man.

998
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,455
Um...

999
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:02,897
- Hmm.
- Guys?

1000
00:51:04,197 --> 00:51:05,834
Mm-hmm.

1001
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:07,737
Uh, are you sure this is safe?

1002
00:51:07,772 --> 00:51:09,167
Don't worry.

1003
00:51:09,202 --> 00:51:11,565
That wild duck is on
a journey of the soul,

1004
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,270
and I say we follow him.

1005
00:51:13,305 --> 00:51:15,602
But just in case,
get out your talons.

1006
00:51:17,078 --> 00:51:19,749
I ain't sure ducks
have talons, though.

1007
00:51:19,784 --> 00:51:21,751
Shh, shh.

1008
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:33,895
Now stretch your back

1009
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:38,427
and move your wings
up to the sky.

1010
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,264
Breathe in.

1011
00:51:40,299 --> 00:51:46,336
And breathe out.

1012
00:51:46,371 --> 00:51:49,042
Excellent, class.

1013
00:51:49,077 --> 00:51:52,276
And now the egg position.

1014
00:51:54,918 --> 00:51:56,885
And we hatch

1015
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,856
with a newborn quack.

1016
00:52:00,891 --> 00:52:03,089
Quack.

1017
00:52:03,124 --> 00:52:04,728
Very good.

1018
00:52:04,763 --> 00:52:06,389
And repeat.

1019
00:52:06,424 --> 00:52:08,930
Quack.

1020
00:52:08,965 --> 00:52:11,064
And repeat.
Quack.

1021
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:13,132
And repeat.

1022
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:15,101
Hey, what's going on here?

1023
00:52:15,136 --> 00:52:17,268
Visitors!

1024
00:52:19,404 --> 00:52:20,942
Brothers, brothers.

1025
00:52:20,977 --> 00:52:22,669
Sisters, hold your enthusiasm.

1026
00:52:22,704 --> 00:52:25,540
We-we don't want to scare
our guests away, do we?

1027
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:27,674
Hello, friends.

1028
00:52:27,709 --> 00:52:29,148
I am Googoo.

1029
00:52:29,183 --> 00:52:32,052
Welcome to our humble abode.

1030
00:52:32,087 --> 00:52:34,890
Abode? What is going on here?

1031
00:52:34,925 --> 00:52:37,123
Our morning relaxation

1032
00:52:37,158 --> 00:52:40,764
as we prepare for
the glorious Earl and Mae

1033
00:52:40,799 --> 00:52:44,163
to open the gates to paradise.

1034
00:52:44,198 --> 00:52:46,462
Oh, you're so lucky.

1035
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:48,299
You're just in time.

1036
00:53:00,786 --> 00:53:02,412
My friends...

1037
00:53:02,447 --> 00:53:06,823
welcome to
the Garden of Harmony.

1038
00:53:15,361 --> 00:53:17,867
I don't understand. It's...

1039
00:53:17,902 --> 00:53:19,726
Heaven for ducks?

1040
00:53:19,761 --> 00:53:21,266
Yep, pretty much.

1041
00:53:37,284 --> 00:53:39,449
Ah. Perfect.

1042
00:53:40,485 --> 00:53:41,583
Whee!

1043
00:53:56,303 --> 00:53:59,700
You came to the perfect place,
my friends.

1044
00:53:59,735 --> 00:54:04,573
Here, humans spare no expense
on our well-being.

1045
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:07,675
And they just finished building
our brand-new slide.

1046
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,644
Yeah!

1047
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,745
So please be our guest.

1048
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,022
Feel free to enjoy our place

1049
00:54:14,057 --> 00:54:16,288
for as long as you like.

1050
00:54:16,323 --> 00:54:18,059
Whoa.

1051
00:54:18,094 --> 00:54:21,557
Well, I guess we could
take the afternoon.

1052
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,967
- Come on. Please.
- Come on. Come on, Dad, please.

1053
00:54:25,002 --> 00:54:26,694
- Come on. Let's stay. Stay.
- Please, please.

1054
00:54:26,729 --> 00:54:28,201
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1055
00:54:28,236 --> 00:54:29,840
I don't think
we can possibly stay here...

1056
00:54:31,305 --> 00:54:34,504
...without having
the best time of our lives!

1057
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:36,737
Now, get out there
and have some fun.

1058
00:54:38,279 --> 00:54:40,048
Slides, here I come!
Wait for me!

1059
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:42,446
Slippy slides!

1060
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:48,958
Woo-hoo! Whoa!

1061
00:54:55,131 --> 00:54:58,396
Here comes the sea dragon!

1062
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,040
We're gonna get you!

1063
00:55:05,075 --> 00:55:07,240
We're gonna squish
your sea dragon face!

1064
00:55:07,275 --> 00:55:09,242
Sea dragon is hungry.

1065
00:55:09,277 --> 00:55:10,705
Hi-yah!

1066
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:15,116
We need to slay the sea dragon!

1067
00:55:16,515 --> 00:55:18,020
Ow. Gwen.

1068
00:55:18,055 --> 00:55:19,615
Gwen, be more careful.

1069
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,683
We need to slay him gently.

1070
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:23,586
Really? Okay.

1071
00:55:26,558 --> 00:55:27,964
Ow! Uncle Dan.

1072
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:29,966
What? I want to play, too.

1073
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:32,199
Sea dragon needs a break.

1074
00:55:32,234 --> 00:55:34,498
Ow! Gwen!

1075
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:58,027
Brothers, sisters, great news!

1076
00:55:58,062 --> 00:56:01,063
Earl and Mae are taking us
on a field trip.

1077
00:56:01,098 --> 00:56:02,999
I'm so excited.

1078
00:56:03,034 --> 00:56:04,594
It's so great. Hurry, guys.

1079
00:56:04,629 --> 00:56:05,760
Hurry. It's time.

1080
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,762
You don't want to miss this.

1081
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:09,830
Come on, everyone. Let's go.

1082
00:56:13,506 --> 00:56:15,506
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1083
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:17,739
I'm so excited.
I can't wait to get started.

1084
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:19,213
Googoo, stop!

1085
00:56:19,248 --> 00:56:20,907
What is it, my little friend?

1086
00:56:20,942 --> 00:56:22,381
The-the chef. The-the...

1087
00:56:23,879 --> 00:56:25,582
You want to come, too?

1088
00:56:25,617 --> 00:56:27,485
- Come on. Let's go.
- You got to stop.

1089
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,026
- Last one is a rotten egg.
- Googoo! Stop!

1090
00:56:30,061 --> 00:56:31,456
- Googoo!
- Kneel, sea dragon, kneel!

1091
00:56:31,491 --> 00:56:33,227
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, Gwenny.

1092
00:56:33,262 --> 00:56:34,591
- Googoo, no! Stop!
- No. Don't hit your father.

1093
00:56:34,626 --> 00:56:36,263
- What?
- We're not hitting fathers.

1094
00:56:36,298 --> 00:56:37,968
- Googoo! Googoo!
- Where are you going?

1095
00:56:38,003 --> 00:56:40,168
Uh, Delroy is
the sea dragon now.

1096
00:56:40,203 --> 00:56:42,104
Of course. I'd love that.

1097
00:56:42,139 --> 00:56:43,633
- You're next!
- No, no, no.

1098
00:56:43,668 --> 00:56:45,206
You're gonna be gentle.
Okay, no...

1099
00:56:45,241 --> 00:56:46,537
- Ow!
- Gwenny, come on!

1100
00:56:46,572 --> 00:56:48,275
He said "gently."

1101
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:49,639
Googoo, he's gonna take you
to his kitchen.

1102
00:56:49,674 --> 00:56:51,212
- Come on.
- He's gonna serve you

1103
00:56:51,247 --> 00:56:52,411
to people, with oranges.

1104
00:56:52,446 --> 00:56:54,017
Hey, hey. What's happening?

1105
00:56:54,052 --> 00:56:56,547
Dad, it's the chef. He's back.

1106
00:57:01,455 --> 00:57:03,752
Earl and Mae are giving
those ducks to the chef

1107
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:05,094
so he can cook them.

1108
00:57:05,129 --> 00:57:06,458
I beg your pardon?

1109
00:57:06,493 --> 00:57:09,164
Dax, go back to Mom.
I'll handle this.

1110
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:11,100
No! I can help! I can just...

1111
00:57:11,135 --> 00:57:12,464
Go back to Mom now!

1112
00:57:12,499 --> 00:57:14,202
Googoo, do not get
on that truck.

1113
00:57:14,237 --> 00:57:15,632
Look, I understand this is all

1114
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:17,634
new to you...
bit weird, bit strange...

1115
00:57:17,669 --> 00:57:19,438
Don't you get it? It's a trap!

1116
00:57:19,473 --> 00:57:21,143
We've got to get your ducks
out of here!

1117
00:57:21,178 --> 00:57:23,079
Everyone, get off the truck
unless you want to be cooked!

1118
00:57:23,114 --> 00:57:24,311
Cooked?

1119
00:57:24,346 --> 00:57:25,213
- What?
- Wait, what's that?

1120
00:57:25,248 --> 00:57:26,775
Come on! Hurry!

1121
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,052
You got to go
before he comes back.

1122
00:57:37,524 --> 00:57:38,622
Let go!

1123
00:57:38,657 --> 00:57:40,591
- Earl and Mae are our leaders.
- Dax?

1124
00:57:40,626 --> 00:57:42,890
- They massage us.
- Dax!

1125
00:57:59,678 --> 00:58:02,118
Everyone, run! Now!

1126
00:58:08,555 --> 00:58:11,061
- Pam, the chef!
- What?

1127
00:58:11,096 --> 00:58:12,887
We have to get out of here now!

1128
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,460
Go, go, go!

1129
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:17,628
Okay, let's go.

1130
00:58:17,663 --> 00:58:19,729
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Go, go, go, go, go!

1131
00:58:19,764 --> 00:58:21,632
Everyone, take off!

1132
00:58:23,603 --> 00:58:25,735
Dax, on my back!

1133
00:58:27,772 --> 00:58:29,970
Hurry!

1134
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:55,204
Guys, we need to rest.

1135
00:58:55,239 --> 00:58:56,832
Follow me.

1136
00:59:07,713 --> 00:59:09,779
Guys, are you okay?
What happened?

1137
00:59:09,814 --> 00:59:11,946
- Mom, he was coming for the...
- I'll tell you what happened.

1138
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:15,081
I told him to stay back, and
he almost got himself killed.

1139
00:59:15,116 --> 00:59:17,424
But, Dad, I was trying to help.

1140
00:59:17,459 --> 00:59:19,162
I don't need your help, Dax.

1141
00:59:19,197 --> 00:59:20,955
I need you to do what I say!

1142
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,364
Do you understand?!

1143
00:59:31,033 --> 00:59:32,472
Listen, Dax.

1144
00:59:32,507 --> 00:59:35,211
Just let us grown-ups
figure it out while...

1145
00:59:40,449 --> 00:59:42,614
All right, everyone,
let's call it a night.

1146
00:59:43,452 --> 00:59:45,683
We could use the rest.

1147
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:59,152
Gwen, you scared me.

1148
01:00:59,187 --> 01:01:01,055
You look mad.

1149
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:03,266
You need a hug!

1150
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:06,236
No, Gwen, I don't need a hug.

1151
01:01:06,271 --> 01:01:07,897
Whoa! I said no hug.

1152
01:01:07,932 --> 01:01:10,537
Don't fight it.
It'll make you feel better.

1153
01:01:14,345 --> 01:01:15,674
Can you let go now?

1154
01:01:15,709 --> 01:01:17,511
- You feel better?
- No.

1155
01:01:17,546 --> 01:01:19,909
Then it hasn't kicked in yet.

1156
01:01:23,618 --> 01:01:25,354
- What about now?
- No.

1157
01:01:25,389 --> 01:01:26,949
- Now?
- Mm-mm.

1158
01:01:26,984 --> 01:01:28,214
- Now?
- Nothing.

1159
01:01:28,249 --> 01:01:29,655
- A little?
- Nope.

1160
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:31,184
I felt something.

1161
01:01:31,219 --> 01:01:32,724
Mm-mm.

1162
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:53,712
Oh, no, he's back!

1163
01:01:53,747 --> 01:01:55,714
Every duck for himself!

1164
01:01:55,749 --> 01:01:57,287
- Kids!
- Dax! Gwen!

1165
01:02:04,285 --> 01:02:06,021
- Mom! Dad!
- No, no, no!

1166
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:08,859
- No, no! Dax, Gwen, stay back!
- No! Stop!

1167
01:02:09,664 --> 01:02:11,191
- Get out of here now!
- Go hide!

1168
01:02:11,226 --> 01:02:12,863
- Hide, kids! Go!
- Go, go!

1169
01:02:27,781 --> 01:02:30,551
No.

1170
01:02:32,786 --> 01:02:34,280
No, no, no.
Mom!

1171
01:02:34,315 --> 01:02:36,458
- Mom, Dad, no!
- Daddy!

1172
01:02:36,493 --> 01:02:39,252
- Oh, kids! Oh, kids!
- No!

1173
01:02:39,287 --> 01:02:41,962
No!

1174
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:45,923
He's gonna cook Mom and Dad,
isn't he?

1175
01:03:45,958 --> 01:03:48,354
And he's gonna come back for us.

1176
01:03:48,389 --> 01:03:51,060
And he'll cook us, too!

1177
01:03:51,095 --> 01:03:55,504
I wish we tasted awful!

1178
01:03:55,539 --> 01:03:57,770
Gwen, we're not giving up, okay?

1179
01:03:57,805 --> 01:04:00,036
We're-we're gonna
figure something out.

1180
01:04:01,105 --> 01:04:02,412
We are?

1181
01:04:02,447 --> 01:04:04,271
Yes. There has to be a way.

1182
01:04:04,306 --> 01:04:06,108
But-but how?

1183
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,011
You can't even fly.

1184
01:04:08,046 --> 01:04:09,518
Oh, we're doomed.

1185
01:04:23,567 --> 01:04:26,502
Gwen, you're a genius.

1186
01:04:27,472 --> 01:04:29,197
Am I?

1187
01:04:34,578 --> 01:04:38,008
We are not getting cooked today.

1188
01:04:41,486 --> 01:04:42,947
Come on, Pam, keep going.

1189
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,381
Pam?

1190
01:04:48,416 --> 01:04:49,921
It's hopeless, Mack.

1191
01:04:49,956 --> 01:04:52,627
What? No, no, no, no, no,
it's not hopeless.

1192
01:04:52,662 --> 01:04:54,992
- We can do this.
- No, we've lost them.

1193
01:04:55,027 --> 01:04:57,467
Mack, we've lost the kids.
You were right.

1194
01:04:57,502 --> 01:04:59,700
We never ever should have
left the pond.

1195
01:04:59,735 --> 01:05:01,130
Pam, enough.

1196
01:05:01,165 --> 01:05:02,769
This isn't you.

1197
01:05:02,804 --> 01:05:05,640
You're the adventurous one,
the-the-the brave one.

1198
01:05:05,675 --> 01:05:07,642
You never give up on anything.

1199
01:05:07,677 --> 01:05:11,173
You-you haven't even
given up on me.

1200
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:12,812
Come on, Pam.

1201
01:05:12,847 --> 01:05:14,484
You've proven
over and over again

1202
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:17,344
that when everything
is hopeless, we have to be...

1203
01:05:17,379 --> 01:05:19,115
Optimistic.

1204
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:22,855
Yes. And now you and me are
going to get our kids back

1205
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:26,760
so we can finish this crazy,
wonderful adventure.

1206
01:05:26,795 --> 01:05:29,455
And we are going to show them
that when danger strikes,

1207
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:31,391
you do not run from it.

1208
01:05:31,426 --> 01:05:33,932
You take a stand.

1209
01:05:34,968 --> 01:05:36,803
That's it! Look, Pa...

1210
01:05:36,838 --> 01:05:39,135
Shh! Shh, shh.

1211
01:05:41,106 --> 01:05:42,369
We can do this.

1212
01:05:42,404 --> 01:05:44,745
Mack, Mack, we can do this.

1213
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:46,516
Come on. Let's go.

1214
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:48,045
Okay.

1215
01:05:49,411 --> 01:05:50,949
Left, Pam.

1216
01:05:50,984 --> 01:05:52,588
- Just... You do your left.
- No, no, no, no. Right.

1217
01:05:52,623 --> 01:05:54,249
Okay, you're moving
on the left. Move on the top.

1218
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:56,625
- Just set...
- Okay, no, no, no, no, no.

1219
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:00,530
- Psst. Hey. Over here. Here.
- Hey. Hey.

1220
01:06:00,565 --> 01:06:01,762
- Here.
- Do it together.

1221
01:06:01,797 --> 01:06:03,225
- Ya mon. Together.
- Do it together.

1222
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:05,458
Wh-Wh-What?

1223
01:06:06,835 --> 01:06:09,770
Together.

1224
01:07:00,053 --> 01:07:00,887
Hmm?

1225
01:07:00,922 --> 01:07:04,088
You trap me for years,

1226
01:07:04,123 --> 01:07:07,520
now you're trying
to cook my friends?

1227
01:07:07,555 --> 01:07:08,862
Enough!

1228
01:07:08,897 --> 01:07:13,361
It is payback time!

1229
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:15,330
Payback!

1230
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,747
Reload.

1231
01:07:25,782 --> 01:07:27,716
Ah...

1232
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:36,087
Eat this.

1233
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:39,480
What?

1234
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:44,485
We're coming!

1235
01:08:51,626 --> 01:08:52,966
Dax!

1236
01:08:53,001 --> 01:08:55,738
We got this, guys.

1237
01:09:04,408 --> 01:09:07,816
We can do this!

1238
01:09:11,283 --> 01:09:12,887
Mom!

1239
01:09:12,922 --> 01:09:15,725
Kids! Oh, kids.

1240
01:09:32,469 --> 01:09:34,634
Woo-hoo!

1241
01:09:37,342 --> 01:09:39,705
Ya mon!

1242
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:48,516
Everyone!

1243
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:49,858
Delroy, you made it!

1244
01:09:49,893 --> 01:09:52,454
You're alive!

1245
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:55,765
I'm so happy to see you.

1246
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:00,033
And you, all dressed up
for Jamaica.

1247
01:10:00,068 --> 01:10:01,463
Look at you!

1248
01:10:01,498 --> 01:10:05,203
Well, come on.
Let's go, go, go, go, go!

1249
01:10:37,336 --> 01:10:39,501
We're almost there, everyone.

1250
01:10:39,536 --> 01:10:41,536
I can feel it!

1251
01:10:45,179 --> 01:10:48,851
Okay, so we're a bit lost.

1252
01:10:48,886 --> 01:10:50,919
Must have missed a turn
somewhere.

1253
01:10:50,954 --> 01:10:52,712
But don't worry.

1254
01:10:52,747 --> 01:10:56,122
We just have to go back
to the big green statue.

1255
01:11:05,133 --> 01:11:07,562
- Pam?
- Hmm?

1256
01:11:16,342 --> 01:11:18,738
Mack, the water.

1257
01:11:18,773 --> 01:11:20,982
It's glowing.

1258
01:11:21,017 --> 01:11:22,643
It's glowing.

1259
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:23,985
It's real.

1260
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:26,955
The water is glowing!

1261
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:31,927
Dad. Dad!

1262
01:11:31,962 --> 01:11:33,929
Come look.

1263
01:11:43,534 --> 01:11:44,698
That's it.

1264
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:46,304
That's Jamaica.

1265
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:00,549
Well, what are you waiting for?

1266
01:12:00,584 --> 01:12:02,782
Lead the way.

1267
01:12:05,127 --> 01:12:07,523
Gwen, final check, please.

1268
01:12:07,558 --> 01:12:08,964
Aye, Captain.

1269
01:12:08,999 --> 01:12:10,526
Tail feather torsion?

1270
01:12:10,561 --> 01:12:11,824
Check.

1271
01:12:11,859 --> 01:12:13,100
Wing deployment?

1272
01:12:13,135 --> 01:12:14,200
Check.

1273
01:12:14,235 --> 01:12:16,004
Heads in Bake-Off mode?

1274
01:12:16,039 --> 01:12:18,039
- Takeoff mode.
- Takeoff mode?

1275
01:12:18,074 --> 01:12:19,436
Check!

1276
01:12:19,471 --> 01:12:21,867
Let's fly.

1277
01:12:33,881 --> 01:12:35,782
Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah!

1278
01:12:35,817 --> 01:12:37,883
Let's go! Come on!

1279
01:12:37,918 --> 01:12:39,786
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

1280
01:12:39,821 --> 01:12:42,129
Woo-hoo!

1281
01:12:42,967 --> 01:12:44,659
Whoa! Whoo!

1282
01:12:46,036 --> 01:12:48,894
- Whoo!
- Woo-hoo! Yeah!

1283
01:12:48,929 --> 01:12:50,863
Look at me!

1284
01:12:50,898 --> 01:12:54,042
Whoa!

1285
01:12:54,077 --> 01:12:56,407
Yeah!

1286
01:12:56,442 --> 01:12:59,575
Woo-hoo!

1287
01:13:03,911 --> 01:13:07,319
I am back!

1288
01:13:07,354 --> 01:13:09,992
Woo-hoo-hoo!

1289
01:13:10,027 --> 01:13:11,686
Hey, Devon!

1290
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:13,358
- Deedee!
- Delroy!

1291
01:13:14,889 --> 01:13:16,999
- Winston!
- Delroy!

1292
01:13:21,137 --> 01:13:23,335
Whoo!

1293
01:13:28,639 --> 01:13:31,409
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

1294
01:13:32,973 --> 01:13:34,709
Wow.

1295
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:38,713
Whoa! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah!

1296
01:13:53,367 --> 01:13:55,532
Wow.

1297
01:13:55,567 --> 01:13:56,731
Hey!

1298
01:13:56,766 --> 01:14:00,042
Hey, you changed your mind.

1299
01:14:00,077 --> 01:14:02,341
Better late than never, right?

1300
01:14:02,376 --> 01:14:04,343
Kim!

1301
01:14:05,148 --> 01:14:06,609
Dax!

1302
01:14:06,644 --> 01:14:08,083
Dax, you're here.

1303
01:14:08,118 --> 01:14:10,844
Wow.
Your wings, they're beautiful.

1304
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:12,483
Thanks.

1305
01:14:12,518 --> 01:14:14,419
Dax kept saying your name
while he was sleeping.

1306
01:14:16,016 --> 01:14:18,060
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1307
01:14:19,294 --> 01:14:22,493
- Whoa!

1308
01:14:22,528 --> 01:14:25,463
- I'm home!
- Delroy! Delroy!

1309
01:14:33,737 --> 01:14:35,242
What?

1310
01:14:35,277 --> 01:14:36,903
Thank you.

1311
01:14:36,938 --> 01:14:38,674
For what?

1312
01:14:39,644 --> 01:14:41,677

No, Gwenny, you cannot take
Toothpick back home.

1340
01:16:01,627 --> 01:16:04,056
But Toothpick wants to come.

1341
01:16:04,091 --> 01:16:06,696
No, no, no. No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1342
01:16:06,731 --> 01:16:10,271
Mm, I think it's time
to let him go.

1343
01:16:10,306 --> 01:16:11,767
Okay, honey?

1344
01:16:11,802 --> 01:16:12,900
Okay.

1345
01:16:14,508 --> 01:16:17,311
So, we're ready for takeoff?

1346
01:16:17,346 --> 01:16:19,412
Wait. Where's your father?

1347
01:16:19,447 --> 01:16:21,073
Guys! Guys!

1348
01:16:21,108 --> 01:16:23,614
Guys!

1349
01:16:23,649 --> 01:16:25,682
I just met these birds
who are totally lost.

1350
01:16:25,717 --> 01:16:27,387
I said we'd help 'em get home.

1351
01:16:27,422 --> 01:16:29,158
What do you say?

1352
01:16:29,193 --> 01:16:31,116
Hello.

1353
01:16:31,151 --> 01:16:33,162
- Hi. Hello.
- Hi.

1354
01:16:33,197 --> 01:16:34,955
Mack, you do know

1355
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:37,023
that penguins are from
the South Pole?

1356
01:16:37,058 --> 01:16:38,530
I know! Isn't that great?

1357
01:16:38,565 --> 01:16:39,729
Yeah!

1358
01:16:39,764 --> 01:16:41,434
We're going to the South Pole!

1359
01:16:41,469 --> 01:16:44,063
No, I'm not going. No way.

1360
01:16:44,098 --> 01:16:46,340
Oh, please, Uncle Dan.

1361
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:48,100
Please...

1362
01:16:48,135 --> 01:16:51,147
Please...

1363
01:16:53,173 --> 01:16:54,579
Okay, okay.

1364
01:16:54,614 --> 01:16:56,911
We're going to the South Pole.

1365
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:58,484
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1366
01:16:58,519 --> 01:17:01,256
Come on, Pam.
We're going to the South Pole.

1367
01:17:01,291 --> 01:17:03,786
I've created a monster.

1368
01:17:03,821 --> 01:17:05,623
Okay, so let's talk itinerary.

1369
01:17:05,658 --> 01:17:08,560
I say Costa Rica, Panama,
Amazon River.

1370
01:17:08,595 --> 01:17:10,265
- Any other ideas?
- Oh, oh!

1371
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:12,025
I want to see Titicaca!

1372
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,027
Titicaca! Great.
